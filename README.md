# File Processor Web Application

This project is a web application that allows users to upload a text file, processes the file to surround the most used word with `foo` and `bar`, and displays the processed text. The project is divided into two main parts:

- **Backend:** Spring Boot RESTful API that handles file upload and text processing.
- **Frontend:** Next.js application that provides a user interface for file upload and displays the processed text.
