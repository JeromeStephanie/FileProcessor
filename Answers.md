# Answers to the File Processor Project Questions

## 1. How much time did you end up spending on this coding test?

I spent approximately 5hrs on this coding test.

## 2. Explain why you chose the code structure(s) you used in your solution and any other specific choices you made.

I chose to structure the code with a clear separation between the frontend and backend for maintainability and scalability. The backend is built with Spring Boot, leveraging a RESTful API approach to handle file uploads and text processing. This structure allows the frontend, developed with Next.js, to interact with the backend in a clean way.

## 3. What would you add to your solution if you had more time?

If I had more time, I would:

- Implement more robust error handling on both the frontend and backend to handle different edge cases, such as network failures, large files, or unsupported file types.
- Improve the user interface with more responsive design elements and better user feedback during file upload and processing (e.g., loading spinners).
- Implement server-side validation to ensure that only text files are processed.

## 4. What did you think of this recruitment test?

I found this recruitment test to be a well-rounded assessment of both backend and frontend skills. It allowed me to demonstrate my understanding of RESTful APIs, file handling, and frontend-backend integration. The test was challenging yet fair, providing a good opportunity to showcase coding abilities while working on a real-world scenario. The structure of the task was clear, and it was enjoyable to work on a project that closely mimics real-world development.
